name: Disabled Workflows

# This file is to keep track of workflows we've intentionally disabled
# for documentation purposes.

# The pages-build-deployment workflow from GitHub Pages is disabled
# We're using our custom jekyll-gh-pages.yml workflow instead
# This prevents duplicate deployments when pushing to main
